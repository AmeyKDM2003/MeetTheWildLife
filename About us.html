                    <p><b>History Of wildlife photography</b></p>
                   <p>
                    In the early days of photography, it was difficult to get a photograph of wildlife due to slow lenses and the low sensitivity of photographic media. 
                    Earlier photos of animals were often captive animals.
                    These included photos of lion cubs taken at the Bristol zoo in 1854 and in 1864, photos of the last Quagga by Frank Hayes.
                    Wildlife photography gained more traction when faster photography emulsions and quicker shutters came in the 1880s.
                    Developments like these lead to photos such as the ones taken by German Ottomar Anschutz in 1884, the first shots of wild birds in action.
                    Members of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) captured early photographs of nesting songbirds in the Philadelphia area in 1897.
                    In July 1906, National Geographic published its first wildlife photos.The photos were taken by George Shiras III, a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania.
                    Some of his photos were taken with the first wire-tripped camera trap.
                   </p>

                   <p><b>Definition Of wildlife photography</b></p>
                   <p>
                    The world's three largest photography organisations, the Photographic Society of America, the Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic Society have adopted a common definition for nature and wildlife photography to govern photography competitions, their respective presidents writing in a joint statement, "The development of a common definition for nature and wildlife photography will be an important step in helping photographers, many of whom enter competitions internationally, know what the rules are. It will also provide organisers with a very clear definition when they need to deal with the problem of ineligible images."
                   </p>

                    <p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems.</p>
